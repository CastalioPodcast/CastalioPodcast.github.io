Hello everyone and welcome to Castálio Podcast!

Our guest for today's episode is the creator of Python Requests: HTTP for
Humans, currently works at Heroku with a pretty cool title, PythonLord, has an
amazing collection of pictures on his Instagram feed, hosts his own Import This
podcast. Also he wrote the "Hitchhiker's Guide to Python", which is a Python
Best Practices Guidebook (which coincidentally was just published recently by
O’Reilly in September and all proceeds from sales are being donated directly to
the Django Girls Foundation!) and many other interesting projects which can be
seen by visiting his Github profile page. Is with a great pleasure that we
welcome Kenneth Reitz to our podcast!

We all know Kenneth from his great programming skills and great Python
libraries, but maybe not everyone know how he have started programming. As you
can imagine, we had to talk about that. We started talking about how he started
programming and his first projects. He told us about the `SplashWear`_, which
was his very first user-facing software. SplashWear features:

* A glorious splash screen.
* A pc-speaker theme song.
* A colored DOS shell with customizable prompt.
* A glimpse into the matrix.
* Lots of easter eggs.

The project is available on Github at `kennethreitz/SlashWear`_ and, thanks for
the folks over at the Internet Archive, you can `run SplashWear in your web
browser`_

Next we talked about how he started programming in Python. And the curiosity is
that he was in doubt between Computer Science, Photograph and Music. Hopefully,
to us, he picked Computer Science and decided to do Photograph and Music on the
side. He had his first Python experience on the Computer Science course, he
liked everything about Python but Classes as he got stuck on understanding how
it works. He continue studying Python and, suddenly, one day, everything made
sense about Python.

Continuing we talked about how Kenneth is involved into other communities and
other programming languages. Basically he is only involved into Python
community and he stressed that he really cares about Python currently. Then we
talked about his cool title at Heroku as PythonOverLord (not PythonLord as we
thought) and what that means as a role. Then he told us how he find time to
take pictures and the good news is that he works from home and that helps him
find time to take those pictures which makes him relax and be a better worker.

It could not be an episode with Kenneth if we did not talk about Python
Requests. We talked about how Python Requests started and how it evolved into
what it is today. Worth mention that Kenneth is really thankful for all the
love Requests receive and the importance it has to the community. We from
Castálio Podcast and we hope our listeners too are very thankful to Kenneth for
building it.

As it was still fresh when we recorded the episode, we talked about the polemic
opinions about Python 3. Kenneth does not like it personally but accepted it as
the Python future, this mostly because he liked how strings worked on Python 2.
That was not just an opinion since he told us how we thought would be better to
fix the strings and default encoding issue. Also he thinks that learning Python
3 is a little bit harder since how bytes type works is a little abstract as a
computer science project. Finally, in his opinion, if you are starting a
project today do it it Python 3 without question.

Continuing, we talked about the `pipfile`_ which is a project that he is
working with `Donald Stufft`_.  The pipfile is under active development (and
design) and there is no code written so far but the read me file, which present
examples and how it should look like when implemented. They are doing the
project this way to collect feedback from the community and make sure when they
get the hands dirty it will be for doing the right thing.

The final thing we talked about is `Kenneth's music`_, specially his first
album published `Unmastered Impulses`_, which "contains tracks inspired by
esoteric spiritual and philosophical concepts, explorations into the dream
state, `bipolar disorder`_, and a `traumatic relationship`_". Kenneth talked
about his passion for music, how he have started and what inspired him to
create the album. The conversation continues and he also comments about how he
built the album artwork. To close this conversation, we talked about Kenneth's
synthesizers and the music live streams he does on Facebook.

We had a great conversation with Kenneth but we also wanted to know his Top 5,
and we did it. Check the Top 5 for Kenneth's recommendations.
